  <h2> By <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_MacNeice">Louis MacNeice</a></h2>
<p>
I am not yet born; O hear me.<br>
Let not the bloodsucking bat or the rat or the stoat or the<br>
club-footed ghoul come near me.<br>
  </p>
  
<p>
I am not yet born, console me.<br>
I fear that the human race may with tall walls wall me,<br>
with strong drugs dope me, with wise lies lure me,<br>
on black racks rack me, in blood-baths roll me.<br>
  </p>  
<p>
I am not yet born; provide me<br>
With water to dandle me, grass to grow for me, trees to talk<br>
to me, sky to sing to me, birds and a white light<br>
in the back of my mind to guide me.<br>
    </p>
<p>
I am not yet born; forgive me<br>
For the sins that in me the world shall commit, my words<br>
when they speak to me, my thoughts when they think me,<br>
my treason engendered by traitors beyond me,<br>
my life when they murder by means of my<br>
hands, my death when they live me.<br>
    </p>
<p>
I am not yet born; rehearse me<br>
In the parts I must play and the cues I must take when<br>
old men lecture me, bureaucrats hector me, mountains<br>
frown at me, lovers laugh at me, the white<br>
waves call me to folly and the desert calls<br>
me to doom and the beggar refuses<br>
my gift and my children curse me.<br>
    </p>
<p>
I am not yet born; O hear me,<br>
Let not the man who is beast or who thinks he is God<br>
come near me.<br>
    </p>
<p>
I am not yet born; O fill me<br>
With strength against those who would freeze my<br>
humanity, would dragoon me into a lethal automaton,<br>
would make me a cog in a machine, a thing with<br>
one face, a thing, and against all those<br>
who would dissipate my entirety, would<br>
blow me like thistledown hither and<br>
thither or hither and thither<br>
like water held in the<br>
hands would spill me.<br>
  </p>
  <p>
Let them not make me a stone and let them not spill me.<br>
Otherwise kill me.<br>
      </p>
